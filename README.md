# CV-repo
This repository is a sneak peek at work on my master's thesis. Its purpose is to show a few Jupyter notebooks as an example of my python, pandas, and data manipulation skills. Unfortunately, since my master's thesis is a work in progress, I cannot show all codes. 

## codes folder
ABL(W_JK).ipynb | Application of ABL method on ASAS-SN dataset. 

CO_rich.ipynb | Classifying stars into Carbon-rich and Oxygen-rich groups.

ogle_vs_asassn.ipynb | Comparing technical characteristics of OGLE III and ASAS-SN data. 

## data folder
asassn_miras_join_gedr3.csv | Mira stars from ASAS-SN archive joined with Gaia EDR3.

asassn_miras_join_gedr3_xm_2MASS.csv | asassn_miras_join_gedr3.csv table crossmatched with 2MASS archive. 

blg_xm_final.csv | OGLE III data from Galactic Bulge crossmatched with 2MASS and Gaia EDR3 archives. 

gdr2_LMC_LPVs_join_2MASSv2.csv | Gaia DR2 long period variables from Large Magellanic Cloud crossmatched with 2MASS archive.

PL_stars_xm_2MASS.csv | Mira stars from Period-luminosity relation crossmatched with 2MASS archive.
